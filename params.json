Working with people, computers and cultures (and preferably a mix of all three) is a joy :-)\r\n\r\nI have significant experience in the PHP world, but am also actively using Ember.js (a single-page application framework) and Ruby on Rails.  I'm also dabbling in Elixir / Phoenix (and have used Objective-C, Python and Perl in the past).\r\n\r\n### Work\r\nI run a web consultancy ([Acorn Web Consultants](http://www.acornwebconsultants.com]) serving small to medium businesses.  We're primarily focused on doing custom web application development, but have a wide range of tech skills (due to years of IT work in the past as well).\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nI'm currently heavily involved with the [Ember](http://www.emberjs.com) community, where I'm a member of the [learning team](http://www.emberjs.com/team/).\r\n\r\n### Contact Me\r\nI'm available on Twitter at [@acorncom](http://twitter.com/acorncom) or you can contact me through our [website](http://www.AcornWebConsultants.com).",
