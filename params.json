I realize more and more that UX is something that has to be thought about from the very beginning of a project if it is going to work successfully for the folks we're working for.\r\n\r\nI currently primarily use PHP (in a variety of projects - Yii, Magento, Drupal, Wordpress, etc), but have had experience with Objective-C, Python, Perl and more over the years.\r\n\r\n### Projects contributing to\r\nI've been contributing to the following projects recently:\r\n\r\n* [Yii](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii)\r\n* [XUpload](https://github.com/Asgaroth/xupload) - maintainer\r\n\r\n### Contact Me\r\nIt's easiest to contact me through my [website](http://www.acorncomputersolutions.com) at the moment.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
